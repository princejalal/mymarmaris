                            <p>As many of us know, the Mediterranean is one of the cleanest seas in the world. Its blue and turquoise waters can attract millions of tourists in every season. The reason why the sea water is so clean is that the coastal cities are meticulous in this regard, but the Mediterranean coast of Turkey is located on the extensions of the Taurus mountains. Since the Taurus Mountains are made up of rocks, there is almost no sand and soil at the bottom of the sea. This factor is the main reason why the waters are clear. With the advantages of this, there are disadvantages. One of the most frequent questions posed to us by the guests who come to Alanya is where I can enter the sea comfortably, where there are sand and rocky ones.

                                <h5>Incekum beach</h5>
                                (Thin sand)- As the name suggests, the best beach in the city is the public beach of Incekum public beach (İncekum halk plajı). Grain-grained beach sands and very shallow waters with the possibility of walking in the sea for at least 500 metres. The perfect beach for those who can\'t swim. There are parking spaces where you can park the car</li>

                                <h5>Okurcalar beach</h5>
                                The coastal part of this town is usually narrow and thin. The cosy place to swim is the Club Aqua Plaza hotel and the beach between Justiniano Club Park Conti. Although the sand color is a bit grey, the entrance to the sea is comfortable and lacks rocky space.</li>
